TradeMapper is a tool which can be used to map trade flow data. Although it has been developed with wildlife trade data in mind, it could be used with any flow data (people, money, carbon). 

Below are some sources of freely available trade data to try out in TradeMapper:

* __CITES__ http://trade.cites.org/ Wildlife trade data
