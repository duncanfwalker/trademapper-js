<p>TradeMapper is a browser-based tool developed for WWF and TRAFFIC to work with data about international trade in wildlife (though you could use it with any kind of data about international flows). It draws flows of traded items as lines on a world map; wider lines show bigger quantities; and coloured dots show the role of countries along the route. You can zoom (scroll wheel) and pan (drag) the map, and filter the data by column values to get insights about what your data means.</p>

<h3 id="where-does-the-data-come-from">Where does the data come from?</h3>

<p>The data is downloaded as a csv from the trade database maintained by CITES. Most of this data represents legal trade in wildlife across countries and within them. However this is not the case for all of the the data in CITES.  For example, the ETIS databse also contains the data on the illegal sale and trafficing of elephants. A great deal of the illegal trade and traffic of wildlife goes unrecorded and at best is recorded by custom officials. </p>

<h3 id="why-use-trademapper">Why use Trademapper?</h3>

<p>One of the advantages of using a tool like Trademapper is that people can bring their own data to visualise and potentially can find data to match campaigns and local issues that matter to them as well. Teams are constantly working to devise interoperable and open processes to allow Trademapper to be customsised for users in different areas (finance, aid) to map flows of their data as well. </p>

<h3 id="who-might-want-to-consider-using-this">Who might want to consider using this?</h3>

<p>The illegal trade in wildlife threatens some of our planetâ€™s most iconic species such as rhinos, tigers and elephants, and evolves rapidly; taking advantage of new routes and other opportunities to avoid detection. To understand and manage the ever-changing trade effectively, scientists and conservationists need to work with large volumes of data that describe international movement of wildlife and wildlife products (like ivory and rhino horn). This helps them understand the spatial patterns of trade, and determine what factors are influencing it and how these can be addressed. These findings then need to be communicated clearly and effectively with decision-makers and the public. Only then can solutions be found, and wildlife protected.</p>

<p>To help, we built TradeMapper: an open source interactive browser-based tool that maps international wildlife trade flow data, allowing users to visualise the global trade in wildlife. TradeMapper offers a way to explore trends, both historical and geographical, in a way that is simply impossible when dealing with dry numerical data in a spreadsheet.</p>

<p>But ultimately, TradeMapper is not limited to wildlife data - it can map international trade of any variety.</p>
